I cannot express just how much she has helped my son, who she began seeing at age 5 and then me as she transitioned to my therapist as my son became older. During my initial contact with her as my 5 yr old son\u2019s therapist she helped us both significantly, my son, with his behavior through recognizing his triggers and providing coping strategies and me in providing constant support and unequaled commitment to both of us. She has helped me through many difficult issues, caring for an elderly parent, marital issues, self- discovery, dealing with an emotionally challenged child, etc.. Maureen is extremely responsive which is essential for continuity of care as well as being available when we need her. It\u2019s actually one of the most remarkable things about Maureen. It still blows my mind when I reach out to her and she is back to me in a timeframe which is unheard of in any medical profession today. Her memory of over 13 years of information involving us is astounding. Even if we have taken extended breaks from sessions it is as if I saw her yesterday. Maureen\u2019s many years in the education system as well as her extensive education has been invaluable for our family. When we experienced a very serious situation with regard to school Maureen was with us all the way. Available for frantic calls as what to do now or how to handle end execute the next step. She was essential to saving my sons academic career and that is no exaggeration. Without her the outcome would have been catastrophic. She attended meetings with me where her expertise and knowledge of the school system was the difference between devastation and redemption. I am not exaggerating at all. In addition to all of this Maureen has also provided many concrete and fruitful recommendations for other professionals. When it was time for my son to find another therapist her recommendation has brought another wonderful therapist into my son\u2019s life which has been a life saver. I love Maureen Tamillow and am in awe of her abilities and her heart. This testimonial for her is an honor.\u201d"
